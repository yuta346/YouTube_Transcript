on bitcoin what did we learn this week i
put up there some of the dynamics
the silliness of it being a gold
equivalent or a coin equivalent
what did we learn i think uh we got
reaffirmation that it's a speculative
asset and it still has a long ways to go
to become a gold equivalent to become a
proper storehold of wealth
something that you can count on to have
purchasing power over time that's going
to have
stable and relatively low volatility
this was not
a low volatility week or so for bitcoin
quite the contrary
rebecca do you see a generational divide
between certain age groups who believe
this is the new gold and other age
groups that just
do not anecdotally yes anecdotally it
does seem that
people who are looking for alternative
uh
sources of cash if you will um you do
have a bit of a younger generation bias
towards the cryptocurrencies versus gold
but
um you know it to me it's it's not the
generation as much as the retail versus
the institutional
the the money that's going into bitcoin
and other cryptocurrencies today is
still
largely retail of course you're getting
a few more corporations you're getting
family offices you're getting some hedge
funds
but the large institutional money that's
thinking about do i want this as part of
the diversifying assets in my portfolio
to protect me from drawdowns from from
bad periods of market stress
we're not there yet it might get there
over time but it's not there yet so this
is still
an asset that i think is primarily one
to be used for return
and speculation over time though rebecca
do you think that investor conditioning
kicks in
many people will ask us when they're not
familiar with financial markets and
macro
why does the yen do so well when things
get bad and there are various ways of
explaining that but one of them is
it just does well it's worked and it's
worked historically
do we need to be conditioned by this
somehow to start believing it
a little bit more well i i think over
time
you you could see that environment come
together and there's a couple things i'd
be watching the big one right now is the
regulatory ecosystem
you know it it's very immature still for
cryptocurrencies and
after the uh colonial pipeline hack paid
for with crypto the ransom was paid for
crypto
i think you are going to see regulators
in the us focusing more on this
trying to make sure there isn't illicit
activity trying to increase transparency
that might make some holders of bitcoin
not want to own it anymore they're there
for the anonymity
but it could create an ecosystem that
gives more
credibility to it more encouragement for
large institutional players to come in
if they come in and you have another
source of liquidity there
that could bring down volatility over
time that's the positive flywheel that i
think
could change how bitcoin and perhaps
other cryptocurrencies are perceived
obviously there's the environmental
issues too which are clearly a problem
for some investors
i think those things need to get
addressed and the volatility needs to
come down
but if those things can happen i think
this could evolve
into some some type of digital gold if
you will
rebecca i want you to elaborate on the
environmental concerns because elon musk
of tesla highlighted this and you
highlighted this in a recent research
report showing
that bitcoin uses up more energy
than say even switzerland when you take
a look at the energy consumption
it's basically a nation unto itself when
it comes to this area
can this be solved how big of a concern
is this for certain investors
well increasingly investors are focusing
on on environmental
and other esg issues so so it is an
increasing concern for a lot of large
institutions
there are ways it can be addressed you
can see changes in the technology used
in bitcoin for example that could reduce
energy usage uh you can see the type of
energy used you know
more of a focus on renewable energy that
could also be a positive trend
there's also another option here which
is that another cryptocurrency that has
lower energy usage but also some of the
positive characteristics like limited
supply
you could see that supplant bitcoin oh
just because bitcoin is the dominant
currency today
doesn't mean it'll always be so i think
there are some different paths but over
time it's going to get addressed one way
or another
meanwhile rebecca i want to pick up on
something that john was talking about
because i know that this dovetails into
the inflation call that bridgewater has
had
this whole cash is trash and uh that rey
dalio was talking about but moving
forward
that inflation's going to be more of a
threat what do you make of the move
recently
lower in longer-term break-even rates
basically longer-term inflation
expectations have come
down even as we get this robust data
yeah i mean our this is such an unusual
time right we're seeing the biggest
u.s boom um that we've had in decades
and we have so many different cross
currents given the reopenings coming out
of the pandemic
demand rising faster than some supply
can meet it you just mentioned that a
few minutes ago in the european pmi data
that that it's hard to have a high
degree of confidence how this is going
to play out but
as we look at the year or so ahead we
see
a decent amount of risk that inflation
could
keep rising it's already rising but stay
higher for longer
and part of that is the supply taking a
while to catch up with the
increasing demand and part of it is more
structural forces
you know globalization which has helped
reduce inflation for years
that's been plateauing and could
possibly reverse a little bit
the the trend towards capital over labor
that's starting to reverse a little bit
as you see higher wages higher minimum
wages etc
and so if you see some of these secular
forces
slowing or reversing somewhat and these
cyclical forces we think you could be in
a slightly higher inflation environment
so the day-to-day moves aside
i think you want to be looking as an
investor does my portfolio
have enough protection if that risk
becomes reality and this isn't just as
the fed likes to say transitory
inflation
rebecca i want to get in trouble with
ray dalio so i'm going to ask a rude
question and you're such a pro you'll
give me an honest answer
right now stock bond correlations are
really quite odd that goes into rate
parity strategies
and such what is the duration the
timeline
of this odd correlation where it begins
to affect portfolios
we're hearing short-term no big deal
when does no big deal become
a big deal so tom i think i don't think
that's a rude question at all i think
you're
you're highlighting a couple things that
that are worth unpacking a little bit
um first when we think about risk parity
strategies all weather which is our
our strategy it's it's a strategic
long-term asset allocation what we're
trying to do is get rid of some of the
volatility that can come with changes in
economic environments growth inflation
and what that allows us to do is get
more steady returns over time
and then we can compound that which is
as einstein said isn't it the eighth
wonder of the world
um so that's a very different strategy
than say pure alpha where we're really
focusing
on uncorrelated return streams that are
over shorter time periods it's more
tactical
for for folks who are thinking about
a risk parity strategy remember it's
never been determined on one asset or
one country
it's going to be a balanced mix of
assets so even if bond yields rise
um there are going to be other bonds
that are still attractive
china for example the 10-year yield
there is still three percent much more
normal policy mix going on and then
you're going to have other assets that
are going to give you that
diversification and that balance
no matter what the environment is but
the other thing tom that i think is
really important that you just said is
about correlation
and i think you know every 60 40
portfolios over the last couple decades
have just been able to sit back and let
it roll in you've had rising stocks and
falling bond yields
and today there is a chance that you're
going to see that relationship break
apart
and you need to understand why that's
happening and then what you do about it
if we think that relationship is
breaking apart in part because of
inflation then you want to make sure
that you don't have too many bonds you
want to make sure that you also have
other assets to protect you against that
risk whether it's gold which has been
recovering nicely recently
inflation-linked bonds even equities
that give you more of a steady cash flow
over time that
aren't going to be as vulnerable to that
duration
issue
